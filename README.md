Stream Dock has a built-in icon library that allows you to add custom icons to Stream Dock keys from a list of pre-made icons. Anyone can add the icons they create to the icon library.

## Icon Library

If you select one of the keys and then right-click the icon in the property inspector, you will see the `Open Icon Library` button in the Stream Dock application.

Clicking it will open a new window containing a list of available icon packs.

Stream Dock comes with a few icon packs, but you can also create your own. Icon packs allow you to distribute your icons to other Stream Dock users. An icon pack is a bundle that contains your icons and some additional information to make it easier to find in our marketplace.
